                <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
                <p class="masthead-subheading font-weight-light mb-0">In our society, irrespective of geographic location, the racial achievement gap between people of black African descent and other races is wide, with black students more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, drop out of school, and be less likely to complete college and earn degrees, all of which can lead to socioeconomic consequences, low job opportunities, less room for social mobility, and less representation in certain fields such as politics. This is an important issue because we thoroughly believe every single student, no matter what race, should have the opportunity to reach the highest levels of academic success throughout their educational journey, whether it be from kindergarten all the way to the tertiary level of learning. By educating more people about this social issue, in addition to those who practice allyship, the achievement gap in the black community will close, resulting in a greater representation of employed people, independence, social mobility, and prosperity, as some factors that lead to this gap in academic success, such as socioeconomic factors, lack of funding, and racism, will be greatly reduced.</p>

                <!-- About Section Content-->
                <div class="container"><p>A theme that has emerged within the educational system is the lack of engagement between some students and instructors. In a study about the engagement between them, an African American student said "The teachers don't care". This creates bad dialogue between students and teachers and makes a bad learning environment. Many students of color also feel as if they would be treated differently if they were white, or if they appealed to their teachers. So why does this matter? With all the different issues facing Black students in our educational system it is hurting them for the rest of their lives. When students are discriminated against while trying to learn to be successful later in life they are being stripped of the ability to make a living for themselves in the future and face increased levels of poverty along with decreased job opportunities. Education is the gateway to success for the rest of your life and if students are receiving less opportunities while in school they will have less opportunities for the rest of their life. Educational opportunities should be available to all people despite their background, race or financial situation. Schooling and education is the foundation and building blocks for kids and their development. We need to do everything in our power to provide for the next generation and the only way to be able to achieve this is by providing opportunities for the people who were not given them to begin with.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The problem with the discipline in schools with kids of different ethnicities. Students are not allowed to be treated by who they are or how they perform in the classroom but by the color of their skin. African American students are often portrayed as deviant or poorly behaved. Studies have shown that these false name tags are responsible for a loss of confidence and poor performance in the classroom. According to the U.S. Department of Education in preschool black children, while only accounting for 18% of the class, are responsible for 48% of out of school suspensions. While the school system punishes students with out of school suspensions they are only making it worse because those students are more likely to do bad in school and get involved in the juvenile justice system. Students of color are not comfortable being themselves in school and are scared of being punished for the color of their skin.

                                    <p class="mb-4">In the video, statistics show that during students’ earlier years of school, the attainment level between white British and black African students is almost the same; additionally, when compared to black African schoolchildren on free school meals (lower income families), the statistics show that it is a bit below that of wealthier kids. One of the beliefs behind this phenomenon is the issue of students having low aspirations during school, which was heavily noted as a common factor affecting African American students after reading literature on this social problem. Parents expecting their children not to attend higher education after secondary education is another factor that contributes to the academic success gap between races. This problem, which we noted from reading scholarly articles, happens due to black African American families tending to live in lower socioeconomic environments and areas, which has always been a problem since the abolishment of slavery. This means it’s hard for families to afford university and all the expenses that come along with it, leading to a repeated cycle of low attainment that is severely dangerous for future generations of students. Furthermore, during later years of schooling, it is noted that during A levels, a form of standardized testing in the United Kingdom, white students from all backgrounds overtake students of black origin, and at university, the difference widens with white students obtaining better degrees and being highly sustained in employment or further education, which directly correlates to earning. Furthermore, the video makes the point that the higher one goes up the educational ladder, the more racist it becomes, which is one of our arguments as well. Issues of slurs are usually ignored in schools, which can affect a student's mental health, leading to a student's inability to focus on schoolwork. In conclusion, barriers based on ethnicity and poverty exist that can make it difficult for students, especially those of black descent, to achieve the highest level of academic and educational success possible. </p>

It tells how African American students in low income families face many disparities in the learning enviroment. Also, it says how when African American students are faced with the disparities of missing class and not having the right materials, they don't get the same opportunites to learn like others in their age group. They are more likely to learn at a slower rate and they are less likely to make it as far in school as their peers.</p>

We selected this image because it helps represent the different races that are in the school system, to express our argument about how race affects academic success for students of color, particularly black students. Race is something that one cannot change about themselves and is a factor in the school system, whether it is a negative or positive effect. Particularly black students residing in low-income communities experience higher rates of educational disparities, which impact their ability to learn in school. Impacting the average rate of black students graduating from high school. Therefore, the diversity in hands show that we should all be equal chances no matter the color one is, but in most cases especially in the school system there is a separation. This following organization is prominently for black African American students to find scholorships to continue their education to encourage more students into furthering their education. https://www.blackscholarships.org/p/black-student-organizations.html</p>

The image shows a cycle that shows us how having a negative schooling experience, due to structural racism, goes on to affect employment, then income, then housing. This is a perfect representation of how race impacts education, causing unequal education opportunities, which causes a lack of black students at universities, affecting everything else in the future. Additionally, an organization that is dedicated to changing racism in education is the Center for Racial Justice in Education. Their mission is educating educators and train them to be able to stop racism and discrimination in education. In order to increase academic success for African American students, the CRJE trains educators, parents, administrators and more in how to stop racial injustice in schools and the community.
